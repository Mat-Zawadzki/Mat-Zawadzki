# Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mateusz Zawadzki


I'm currently working on a 2d platformer in C++ using OpenGL. Yes wish me luck!
<br><br><br><br>
I urge you to look through my other repositories - even though I still need to clean them up. 
<br><br><br><br>
I'm looking for a Data analyst or a software engineering position
