# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mateusz Zawadzki


I'm currently working on OpenGL/GLFW/GLAD in C++  to make a game from scratch. Yes wish me luck!
<br><br>
I urge you to look through my other repositories - even though I still need to clean them up. <br><br>


I'm looking for a Data analyst or a software engineering position
